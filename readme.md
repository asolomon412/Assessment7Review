### What is an API? How does it help us?
It allows us to get information from an external source.

### What are two common data formats used with APIs?
JSON & XML

### What programming language(s) can be used to access REST APIs?
Pretty much any language.

### Steps to use RestTemplate

##### 1. Look up the documentation
* What are the endpoints (aka the URLs & Methods)
* What parameters do you need to pass?
* What headers do you need to pass?
* What does the response look like?
* Does it require an account, a key, or a login?

##### 2. Create model classes
Generally, for every object in JSON, you need a model class.

##### 3. new RestTemplate()

##### 4. Set up headers (depending on the API)

##### 5. Build the URL
